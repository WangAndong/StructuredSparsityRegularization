This is an implementation of a structured sparsity regularization method with total variation and l2 constraints. It can be used to obtain sparse and smooth linear models.

The method is described in https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01167861/file/ConvexECML2015.pdf


To run the example in python:

1) Make sure you have installed scipy,numpy,sklearn, and nilearn python packages
Note: these can all be easily installed with the python pip utility

2) Run the Synthetic_Example.py 

3) Run the FMRI_Example.py this might take 5-10 minutes to complete. 


The matlab example is very basic.
